 abstract = {In real-world problems related to finance, business, and management, mathematicians and economists frequently encounter optimization problems. In this classic book, George Dantzig looks at a wealth of examples and develops linear programming methods for their solutions. He begins by introducing the basic theory of linear inequalities and describes the powerful simplex method used to solve them. Treatments of the price concept, the transportation problem, and matrix methods are also given, and key mathematical concepts such as the properties of convex sets and linear vector spaces are covered.George Dantzig is properly acclaimed as the "father of linear programming." Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a situation. It can be used to minimize traffic congestion or to maximize the scheduling of airline flights. He formulated its basic theoretical model and discovered its underlying computational algorithm, the "simplex method," in a pathbreaking memorandum published by the United States Air Force in early 1948.Linear Programming and Extensionsprovides an extraordinary account of the subsequent development of his subject, including research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems.Dantzig first achieved success as a statistics graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. One day he arrived for a class after it had begun, and assumed the two problems on the board were assigned for homework. When he handed in the solutions, he apologized to his professor, Jerzy Neyman, for their being late but explained that he had found the problems harder than usual. About six weeks later, Neyman excitedly told Dantzig, "I've just written an introduction to one of your papers. Read it so I can send it out right away for publication." Dantzig had no idea what he was talking about. He later learned that the "homework" problems had in fact been two famous unsolved problems in statistics.},

    abstract = { The special class of linear programs described as network flow problems includes many of the special structure optimization problems in such areas as assignment, transportation, catering, warehousing, production scheduling, etc. Besides the physical motivation of the flow description, this class of problems possesses conceptually simple, and computationally elegant, solution techniques originated by Dantzig, Ford, Fulkerson, et al. This paper describes a generalization of this class of problems to “process-flow networks,” or “flow with gains,” in which flow in any branches of the network may be multiplied by an arbitrary constant, called the branch gain, before leaving the branch and flowing into the remainder of the network. This generalization permits the description of networks in which different kinds of flow may be converted one to another, without “constant returns to scale.” Among other interesting problems, this model includes the metal-processing problem, the machine-loading problem, financial budgeting, aircraft routing, warehousing with “breeding” or “evaporation,” the two-equation capacitated linear program, etc. The solution method here described and proved is a natural extension of Ford and Fulkerson's technique (or specialization of the primal-dual method) and retains much of the physical motivation and easy computational aspect of their technique, a direct starting solution is usually available, and optimization of the imbedded linear program (the restricted primal problem) can be accomplished without the use of the simplex technique. Conceptually, the solution procedure consists of the following steps Find the incrementally cheapest loop in the network that will absorb flow Establish as much additional flow into the network along this route as possible Repeat Steps (1) and (2) until the desired flow is established, or until infeasibility is discovered The solution technique includes a maximal-flow procedure and produces a “min-cut equals max-flow” theorem for networks with gains. Additional features, such as piece-wise linear convex costs, parametric studies, network “tearing,” mixed boundary conditions, etc., may be easily incorporated in the algorithm. }
