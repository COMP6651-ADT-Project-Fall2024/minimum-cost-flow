Requirements:
----------------
The below are what we used to run the project with a single click in our own systems. If you are more comfortable with other IDEs and most recent Java versions, then you may also use them.
- IntelliJ ([Install](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/))
- JDK 17 ([Install using OpenJDK](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=807&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All))

We have not used any third party libraries for this project, so nothing else is required!

How to run?
----------------
- The main method for this project is in MinCostFlow class.
- So after compiling the project, run the main() method in MinCostFlow class.
- When you run it, you are prompted to either run tests or run simulations
- If you choose to run tests, then tests will be run on all the algorithms and results will be displayed
- If you choose to run simulations, then you are asked whether you want to run simulations 1 or simulations 2
- You can choose any of those 2, to see how Simulations are working

Outputs:
--------------
- You can see the graph files that are generated in minimum-cost-flow\src\main\resources.
- And the outputs of tests and simulations can be seen the console.
- The outputs that you see in the terminal/console are formatted clearly according to the tables, so everyone can understand what is going on.

Reports:
-------------
The details of tests and simulations are clearly mentioned in the report. Please see the report for more details.
